Added yelith root to bad lootlist.
Fixed Darkbox processing of mundane gems.
Darkbox will now properly recognize if the script is started in the Darkbox room.
Added several metrics to track win percentage and cost per win for Dropbox.  Type YES in-game and receive the "A good positive attitude never hurts" message to see the output in the log window.  Will properly add these to the other games soon.
